(Once again,
I'm locked in with TP,
we finna make a hit)
Pussy nigga, blrrrd, ayy
FDO, FTF, first day out, bitch,
fuck the feds
Walked out the jail,
I saw six foreigns,
I just got out the bunk bed
Three million cash,
can't fit in my hands,
then sit some on my head
Bae, come put that pussy on me,
bitch,
I'm fresh from out the feds
(On God)
I say fresh from out the feds,
baby,
come put that pussy on me
(Put that pussy on me)
Turnt as fuck in the strip club,
ran out of ones,
started throwin' hundreds
Nigga, I can't fumble shit,
the whole world been waitin'
on it
(Yup)
Tucked that knife all
way to R&D,
gave it to my lil' homie,
nigga
(Let's go)
Ain't no more Mufasa,
Mr. Goldman,
I catch jets to Johnny
(Yup)
Ain't no more outfits
from Southland Mall,
this setup made in London
(Yup)
Couple hoes jumped off my bid,
majority waited on me
(Fuck 'em)
She just actin' faithful
to you 'til I get home,
trust me, homie
(I stamp that)
Feel impatient,
I might do a demonstration
off GP
(This one here on me)
I ain't shot nothin' in
like four years,
I ain't sent a hit in three
(On GP)
Don't let Durk verse go to
your head,
ain't nobody slime as me
(I stamp that)
I'm the one from 'round
the corner where they
snaked Martin Luther King
(Yup)
Extra aggressive out in
traffic 'cause Hank ain't
in the backseat
(Free Hank)
Everywhere I go,
it's cars trailin'
'cause Reckless ain't
drivin' me
(Long live the gang)
I get mad when I look around
and my members ain't
where they 'posed to be
A whole war goin' on,
I'm stuck in the cage,
it drove me crazy
(Did that time, Shiesty,
stay out the way)
30, pass me that Drac'
(Blrrrd)
(Say fuck the hood,
Memphis ain't no good)
Get your bitch ass out my face
(Blrrrd)
Unfortunately,
I'm CEO and the top shooter
for my gang
My grandma told me keep my
grass low, the whole time,
I'm the snake
(A slime)
Smelled his plot from like
three miles away,
he can't outsnake a snake
I ain't choose the streets,
they chose me,
steppin' on shit my lane
I ain't choose to rap,
it chose me,
my name held too much weight
Type influence I got where
I'm from,
got Yo Gotti totin' a Drac'
(On God)
When you meet me,
you gon' get real
motivated same day
(On God)
Them tear drops played out,
go get your favorite bullet
on your face
(On God)
Do not rap when I am told,
I rap when I got shit to say
SF90, I'm allergic to Corvettes,
fuck a C8
(Lil' nigga)
This an F8, not a C8, nigga,
Mansory edition
In the May-May, oh my God,

edition
(That Maybach)
In the Wray-Wray, widebody,
Cullinan, Black Badge edition
(That Rolls-Royce)
In the same Scat Pack

lil' nigga
(Yup)
We all on a race to the top,
these niggas stuck,
can't get no bigger
(Say what?)
I got richer while in jail,
locked in the feds
outdoin' niggas
(On God)
Now my watch got on a watch,
my chain got more chains
than you niggas
Ain't no such thing as
real niggas,
but I'm damn sure
ain't counterfeit
(I ain't fakin' this shit)
Hid ten M's in the bank,
then went fed,
got penitentiary rich
(I'm still filthy rich)
Orderin' Ferraris off
a jail call, I'm real rich
Make sure she cover my name
up if you plan on keepin'
the bitch
(Fuck her)
I signed a deal,
then went to jail,
they ain't even seen me pop
my shit
(On gang)
I'm just now buyin' a chain
that say my name,
I been bullshittin'
My niggas died while in chains,
get-back gang,
I'm right back for revenge
(Gang, on gang)
Ayy, I'm just way more colder,
every eight hours,
I'm changin' fits
(What?)
Every seven, I change the bitch
(What?)
nothin' but foreigns when
we change lanes
(Blrrrd)
Hood poet,
all these jewels I drop,
how you ain't make a chain?
(Goofy)
He ain't dead,
but I got niggas in the
feds smokin' Lil Wayne
(Big Tunechi)
Soon I see my Memphis homies,
ayy, man, say, man
(What up?)
I had nine M's to my name,
makin' chi-chis out Shabangs
Reorganized my whole gang,
on Sundays, we work on our aim
(On God)
And every month on
the thirteenth,
I'm boppin' out with
a new chain
I heard street niggas
gettin' tummy tucks,
told you these rappers lame
(Man, these niggas gay)
In my cell,
I did a thousand burpees,
I toned up my frame
(Thousand of 'em straight)
Fitted suit on,
fitted cap turned backwards,
Richard Millie plain
(Patek plain jane)
Them steppers
who got him served,
they wasn't doin' it for
lil' Saint
See, my daddy my first co-D,
jumped in the streets,
he showed me lanes
(Them facts)
Your daddy a killer,
but you ain't,
you just like Bronny James
(Facts)
I asked her where she want
my kids,
she told me grab the brush
and paint
So I aimed right at her
forehead and tried to spell
out my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got locked,
niggas dropped million
dollars worth salt around
my gang
(Right there by my name, nigga)
Please tell me that shit fell
up out they pockets, skinny man
Please tell these rap
niggas sayin', "Blrrrd,"
without permission that
they stealin'
(Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd)
Memphis menace, kids,
say no to drugs and damn
right to killin'
(Blrrrd)
She choose,
but her lips ain't move,
I read her eyes, they said,
"Pimp me"
See, bae,
I'm least likely some pimpin',
but I'm more likely a bachelor
Super Shiesty, crooked letter,
crooked letter, David Banner
(Slatt)
In the trap, feelin' like O-Dog,
watchin' hits I did on camera
(I shoot shit on camera)
Out on papers with
a 922G sittin' on my counter
(Say what?)
I'm out on papers with
a fully ARP sittin' on
the counter
(Blrrrd, that blrrrd)
If you think you got more
shots than CG,
come and try your luck
(Pussy)
You ain't never bought no
crate or no grenade,
shut the fuck up
(Shut y'all broke-ass up, nigga)
I just ordered a gun store,
nobody ain't got more
chops than us
(On God)
901, 375, 0762, call my bluff
I treat a player like
a player and a custo
like a cluck
You need to treat your
glizzy like a collared
shirt and button it up
(Ah, ah)
I treat gangsters
like civilians,
I treat smart niggas like
ducks
(Quack)
Long story short,
short story shorter, nigga,
I cannot be touched
(At all)
Cannot slip up,
can't get on books,
can't go out sad,
can't get out far
(The fuck?)
I sicced a C girl on the opps,
she left an AirTag in his
glove box
(Slatt)
KD patient,
he might spank 'em next year
or tomorrow
I took my homie Dummo
Glock 'cause he went out
like Cheddar Bob
(Fuck him)
Thank every bitch I had to
shit on for these foreigns
in my garage
(They custom)
Every bitch who lost faith in
me named after one of my cars
Where y'all? Stolo still parked,
stuffin' zaza in pickle jars
(Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrd)
If my Drac' jam on me,
we beefin',
I'ma turn Kendrick Lamar
He got his car flipped on Lamar,
died with his gun,
he couldn't even shoot
I'm CEO, I cannot go,
even my strikers bulletproof
All my hoes from Memphis
still allowed to call me
Mr. Pooh
Seven foreigns, rose gold,
my first day out, damn fool,
blrrrd
(Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Rooster-ass nigga
